Gorgeous and unique venue

We chose the Sessions House for our wedding reception as we wanted somewhere with character and we wouldn't be at risk of the British weather - especially given a December wedding! We were thrilled with our time there - and working with Erika before the event was really good as we managed to plan everything. The place was done up with amazing Christmas decorations - which is exactly what we wanted - but Erika also made sure that the small touches that we wanted doing were done how we agreed.
